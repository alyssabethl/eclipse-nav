    <h2>What Are Baily's Beads Anyway?</h2>
    <p>
        During a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely covers the Sun, some sunlight escapes from the edges in an irregular pattern. 
        This phenomenon occurs due to the rugged surface of the Moon, where valleys and craters allow small bursts of sunlight to pass through,
        forming what is known as Baily’s beads. This effect was first vividly described by English astronomer, Francis Baily, in 1836, following 
        his observations of an annular solar eclipse. His detailed account led to the epony- mous naming of the phenomenon.

        An important aspect of Baily's Beads is that they do not shine with equal intensity from all craters, lunar mountains, and lunar valleys. 
        We also know that not all lunar topography is visible from everywhere on Earth. With that said, it is inevitable to deduce that the appearance 
        and brightness of Baily’s beads vary depending on the observer’s position.These facts can be utilized to determine the observer’s precise position. 
        By leveraging lunar limb profiles derived from topographic datasets, such as those obtained from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), we reconstruct
        the expected bead patterns for various geographic locations. We then apply image processing and feature extraction techniques to eclipse im- ages to match
        the observed bead sequences with predicted models, thus estimating the photographer’s position.

        This project is the development of a computational pipeline that combines image-based detection of Baily’s Beads, 3D lunar topography (SLDEM2015[8]),
        and ephemeris-based observer modeling. By extracting limb brightness profiles from eclipse images and matching them with simulated limb projections based on
        known crater geometry, we identify the specific lunar features responsible for bead formation. Using this crater-bead correspondence, we then reverse engineer 
        the eclipse geometry to estimate the observer’s terrestrial coordinates.

        This methodology introduces a novel approach to GPS-free Earth localization using natural astronomical events, with potential applications in celestial navigation, 
        eclipse path validation, and lunar surface modeling. The results demonstrate that Baily’s Beads are not merely beautiful but can serve as measurable, reproducible, and 
        location-dependent signals in computational perception.

                In 2020, researchers at Wuhan University developed an algorithm to compute the geometric component of sky irradiation during an eclipse using Moon topography from 
                the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. They also modeled the Baily’s beads of the 2012 solar eclipse observed in Lakeland, Australia

                 for accurate coordinate calculations.

                One key contribution was the manual detection of 37 disappearing beads tracked frame-by-frame to create light intensity curves. Challenges such as codec incompatibility and file size 
                limits were overcome using preprocessing tools like VirtualDub. This dataset supports future solar radius estimation and lunar limb reconstruction.
